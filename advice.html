<h3 align="center">Advice for College</h3>
 <ul>
    <li>When in doubt, refer to a professor, regardless of gender, as "Mrs. [Name]."</li>
    <li>If you forget the name of a professor, simply refer to them as "Mrs. Nameless"</li>
    <li>Being excited about a topic is the worst way to learn.</li>
    <li>Sleep if for the weak. Breaks and proper sleeping schedules only hinder you.</li>
    <li>If you believe you would enjoy a diverse college, go to <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/">Princeton</a>.</li>
    <li>Ensure that you nclude the results of all math competitions you have ever participated in on your application.</li>
    <li>This is especially true for very small regional ones.</li>
    <li>This includes competitions you performed poorly in. Simply preface your result with "there were many participants"</li>
    <li>Go to <a href="https://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a> for your Undergraduate Mathematics degree.</li>
    <li>Ensure that your email address is as long and unprofessional as possible.</li>
    <li>It is completely acceptable to ask Professors about their syllabus and other easily found information.</li>
    <li>Deadlines are always optional. Extensions are rarely provided.</li>
    <li>There is only one college that is perfect for every student: <a href="https://www.s-vfu.ru/en/">North Eastern Federal University</a>.</li>
    <li>Do what you think will get you a job. Your passions will get you nowhere.</li>
    <li>The only mathematical job is teaching.</li>
</ul>


    <!--<p>Okay. So what can you do with a degree in mathematics? Actually,
      just about
      anything. No really, we mean it.</p>
    <p><b>Studying mathematics seriously</b> prepares you for almost any
      career
      (not just high-school or college teaching or pure mathematics
      research). Here
      are some links to check out which support this theme with actual
      data and
      reasoning:</p>
    <ul>
    	 <li><a href="http://math.duke.edu/undergraduate/why-math-major">Why Study Math?</a> asks Duke University---and then provides answers, including data from 2014. </li>
    	 <li><a href="http://weusemath.org/">We Use Math</a>, declares the BYU Math department, and gives a pile of career profiles.</li>
      <li><a href="http://math.uga.edu/~curr/WhyMath.html">Why

      <li>Here's a <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2004-07-18-new-masters_x.htm">news    article</a> from 2004 that accurately captures the career
        outlook of many students (excerpt <a href="#usatoday">below</a>).
        It suggests a <a href="http://www.sciencemasters.com">professional
          master's degree</a> as an excellent option.</li>

    </ul>
    <p>For pretty much any list you can make of aspects you'd like in a
      job (dress
      up? just jeans? work with people? work on your own? etc.), there's
      some
      mathematical career that's right for you. One of the reasons that
      mathematically-trained people are needed in almost every field is
      that we are
      known for our excellent problem-solving and critical thinking
      skills.</p>
    <p>According to multiple ratings, many of the
      most desirable careers are technical in nature and require some expertise in the
      mathematical
      sciences:

      </p>
    <p><strong>Some of the career opportunities available to a major in
        mathematics
        include:</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Actuarial Mathematics</strong> -- The application of
      mathematics,
      particularly probability and statistics, to the insurance
      industry. For more
      info, check out <a href="http://www.beanactuary.org/">Be An
        Actuary</a>, which
      is supported and maintained by the actuarial professional
      societies and some
      major employers. The Princeton Review has an <a
        href="http://www.princetonreview.com/careers/3/actuary">Actuarial
Career
        Profile</a>. Here is also an <a
        href="https://www.dwsimpson.com/">actuarial job recruiting</a> site

      <strong><br>
      </strong>A related career to that of an <strong>actuary</strong>
      is that of
      a<strong> Research Analyst. </strong>They research compensation
      trends and
      problems internally and externally; perform statistical analyses
      and predictive
      modeling on current and proposed compensation scenarios; measure
      performace of
      field sales (insurance reps) against established goals; model and
      track
      incentive and bonus programs; determine economic impact of various
      scenarios on
      the company and the individual. This job specifically requires a
      mathematics
      degree.</p>
    <p><strong>Applied Mathematics</strong> -- Often this means working
      on problems
      in physics, chemistry, geology, and engineering from a
      mathematical
      perspective. There are seemingly endless possibilities, ranging
      from being a
      <strong>climate analyst</strong> who models long-term changes in
      global weather
      to working as a <strong>forensic analyst</strong> who
      investigates data
      collected at crime scenes to being a <strong>population ecologist</strong>
      who
      works to prevent species from becoming endangered. For more info,
      check the
      Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics' <a
        href="http://www.siam.org/careers/">career</a> site, especially
      their pages on
      <a href="http://www.siam.org/careers/thinking.php">Thinking of a
        Career in
        Applied Mathematics?</a>. Most government jobs, such as with <a
        href="http://www.sandia.gov">Sandia</a>, <a
        href="http://www.anl.gov/">Argonne</a>, or <a

      <a href="http://www.nist.gov/">NIST</a>, or the <a
        href="http://www.usda.gov/">Dept. of Agriculture</a> are within
      applied
      mathematics. Some positions at the <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/">National
Security
        Agency</a> are applied mathematics and some are pure
      mathematics.
      Here's a report from a 1998 workshop on <a
        href="http://www.siam.org/news/news.php?id=870">how mathematics
        is used in
        industry</a>. Courses in mathematical modeling are helpful in
      preparing for a
      career in applied mathematics.</p>
    <p><strong>Biomathematics -- </strong>The application of
      mathematics in the
      health sciences. It's an up-and-coming field, and has been a big
      trend within mathematics in recent years. The Society for Mathematical Biology
      lists <a href="http://www.smb.org/education/index.shtml">undergraduate
        and graduate
        programs</a>. Biomathematics includes bioinformatics, a sort of
      cs/math/biology
      hybrid field. The Bioinformatics Organization has <a
        href="http://www.bioinformatics.org/jobs/">job listings in
        bioinformatics</a>.
      There's plenty of information  <a
        href="http://www.colorbasepair.com/"> at colorbasepair</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Biostatistics</strong> -- The application of
      statistics in the health sciences. Here are the <a
        href="http://www.amstat.org/careers/biostatistics.cfm">ASA</a>
      and <a
href="http://www.public-health.uiowa.edu/careers-in-biostatistics/">UIowa</a>
      and <a href="https://www.biostat.washington.edu/about/careers">UWash</a>
      biostatistics
      careers pages.</p>
    <p><strong>Computer Science</strong> -- This is a field on its own, with lots of research subfields that are almost indistinguishable from mathematics. 
      One of
      the mathiest practical parts is <strong>graphics and animation</strong>.
      Here, a
      great example is Pixar, where employees <a
        href="http://graphics.pixar.com/library/">publish research
        papers</a> involving
      things like using differential equations to make sure animated
      clothing doesn't
      intersect itself. Another especially mathy part is the
      <strong>cryptography</strong> involved in <strong>network
        security</strong>; <strong></strong>think e-commerce and
      mathematical algorithms
      like RSA and Rijndael. Here's <a
        href="http://www.garykessler.net/library/crypto.html">a detailed
        overview of
        cryptography for networks</a> from Gary Kessler. A high level of
      mathematical
      ability and background is needed. Consider a double major.</p>
    <p><strong>Financial Mathematics (or Mathematical Finance, also
        known as
        Quantitative Finance)</strong> -- Mathematics used on Wall
      Street, for mortgage
      backing, financial derivatives, and stock market analysis.
      Sometimes people in
      this profession are referred to as "quants." Stony Brook has <a
href="http://www.ams.sunysb.edu/%7Efrey/QuantitativeFinance/Resources/CareerGuide/">excellent
        information</a>.&nbsp; Here's a <a
        href="http://quantlib.org/books.shtml">short book
        list</a> and a <a href="http://finmath.com/">long book list</a>.
      There are lots of professional master's programs
      (see <a
href="http://www.google.com/search?q=mathematical+finance+masters">google</a>
      and <a
href="http://www.google.com/search?q=financial+mathematics+masters">google</a>).
      There are plenty of mathematics graduates who are
      <strong>traders</strong>, working with <strong>stocks</strong>,
      <strong>commodities</strong>, or with <strong>foreign exchange</strong>.<br>
    </p>
    <p><b>Knitwear</b> -- Higher mathematics is rarely used directly in
      the knitwear industry, but the types of abstraction and rigorous
      thinking in which mathematicians are trained are used all the
      time.  <a href="http://kateatherley.com/">Kate Atherley</a>
      is a technical editor of knitting patterns.  <a

      (<a href="http://www.melaniefalickbooks.com/qa-with-reversible-knitting-au/">interview</a>)
      creates technically innovative designs. Or, do it all: Amy
      Herzog has dual careers as <a
        href="http://www.amyherzogdesigns.com/">knitwear designer</a>
      and cybersecurity researcher (here are two <a

    <p><strong>Law or Medicine</strong> -- A major in mathematics is a
      good
      preparation for law or medical school. Here are a <a

    <p><strong>Music</strong> -- It's not a common or easy career, but
      you can do
      it; witness Jennifer Parkin (<a href="http://www.ayria.com/">Ayria</a>),
      who
      earned her math degree from UWaterloo. Straddling the math/music line are <a
        href="http://mctague.org/carl/">Carl
        McTague</a>, Ph.D. mathematician and composer, and <a href="http://www.kitarmstrong.com/">Kit
        Armstrong</a>, professional composer and pianist with a master's degree in mathematics. </p>
    <p><strong>Operations Research</strong> -- The application of
      mathematics to
      problems of optimization and decision-making, especially for
      large-scale or complex problems and
      often in the field of business.  In other words, OR
      people attack every practical problem you've ever thought of, from
      economic impact of airline safety measures to relocating
      endangered species of plants.  The discipline is sometimes
      called
      Management Science or Industrial Engineering. For more info,

    <p><b>Public Health and Epidemiology</b> --&nbsp; Epidemiologists
      study the spread of diseases
      and model how to respond to epidemics. A basic introduction to
      mathematical
      epidemiology can be found in Chapter 1 of <a href="http://www.math.smith.edu/Local/cicintro/cicintro.html"><em>Calculus
          in
          Context</em></a>.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/">Centers
        for Disease Control and Prevention</a> employ statisticians and
      mathematicians to model disease and study preventions and
      interventions. The University of British Columbia Med School's
      Centre for Disease Control has a <a
href="http://med.ubc.ca/world-health-organization-recognizes-division-of-mathematical-modeling-as-collaborating-centre/">Division
        of Mathematical Modeling</a>. Here are <a href="http://www.phii.org/defining-public-health-informatics">two</a> <a href="https://www.amia.org/applications-informatics/public-health-informatics">descriptions</a> of public health informatics.</p>
    <p><strong>Public Policy</strong> -- A mathematics degree can lead
      to advisory
      positions in educational and/or science policy as well as work in
      quantitative
      public policy. <a
        href="http://www.cbpp.org/about/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=47">Gillian
        Brunet</a>
      used her mathematics major to work in public policy.   Here is the program for a recent <a href="http://jointmathematicsmeetings.org/meetings/national/jmm2016/2181_program_ss54.html">AMS Special Session on Mathematics and Public Policy</a>. A
      master's
      degree in public policy is useful for a public policy career (see <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=masters%20public%20policy">google</a> to find programs).</p>
    <p><strong>Research Mathematics</strong> -- The study of mathematics
      for its
      own sake. Just about any mathematics faculty member will be more
      than happy to
      chat with you about this. As a career, this almost always requires
      graduate
      school; to investigate the possibilities, think about doing
      something during the
      <a href="mathsummer.html">summer</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Statistics</strong> -- The study of methods for
      collecting,
      classifying, analyzing and making inferences from data. There are
      <em>tons</em>
      of jobs in statistics. For more info, check the&nbsp; <a

    <p><a name="usatoday"></a> excerpt from "Add science, business,
      mathematics and
      stir"<br>
      By Del Jones, USA TODAY --- posted July 18/19, 2004</p>
    <p>...Mathematics major Rebekah Stephenson taught high school for a
      year after
      graduating from Ohio State University, but, she says, "People who
      really love
      math are not going to teach algebra." And she didn't want to get a
      Ph.D. in
      math only to spend years working on something that would be read
      by a few other
      mathematicians working in the same subfield of expertise.</p>
    <p>Many students strong in science and math face similar career
      dilemmas,
      fueling a stampede into places like law school just as global wars
      are being
      waged in biotechnology, cryptology, nanotechnology, forensic
      chemistry,
      environmental science and the like.</p>
    <p>That has led to the creation of a new master's degree, the <a
        href="http://www.sciencemasters.com">professional science
        master's</a> (PSM),
      which promises to be the hot degree no one seems to have heard of
      ---
      yet....</p>
    <p>...The PSM is being called the MBA for scientists and
      mathematicians....<br>
      Experts predict it will become the 21st century's fastest ticket
      to the major
      leagues in business and government.... Philip Tuchinsky [is] a
      project manager
      at Ford Motor who has a Ph.D. in mathematics... Employees with a
      math
      background see business from a unique point of view and are
      becoming valuable
      as companies mine and analyze mountains of data, Tuchinsky says.</p>
    <p>...Stephenson, 25, received a PSM in industrial mathematics from
      Michigan
      State in 2002 and is now project engineer for Essayons Consulting
      Engineers,
      where she designs storm water drainage systems for new
      construction projects in
      Tacoma, Wash. "The main commodity of being a mathematician is
      reasoning,"
      Stephenson says. "The main preparation element missing in a
      typical math
      program is how to market this incredible ability."</p>
    <p>"The students that we turn out are not future cubicle rats, but
      future
      project managers," says Charles MacCluer, director of Michigan
      State's PSM
      program in industrial mathematics. "Business is getting too
      scientific to be
      managed by businessmen," he says. "They need a new hybrid, a
      scientifically
      trained person."</p>-->
